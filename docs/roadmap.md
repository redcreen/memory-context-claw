# Roadmap

[English](roadmap.md) | [中文](roadmap.zh-CN.md)

## Scope

This page is the stable roadmap wrapper for the repo. It shows milestone order and current program direction without replacing the live execution control surface.

For live work state, read:

- [../.codex/status.md](../.codex/status.md)
- [../.codex/module-dashboard.md](../.codex/module-dashboard.md)

For detailed queues, read:

- [project workstream roadmap](workstreams/project/roadmap.md)
- [unified-memory-core/development-plan.md](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md)

## Now / Next / Later

| Horizon | Focus | Exit Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Now | keep the newly closed Stage 4 policy loop stable while Stage 5 planning opens | Stage 4 policy reports, loops, and regressions stay green while the next hardening slice is defined |
| Next | harden standalone operation, release boundary, and reproducibility | one Stage 5 hardening slice is named and agreed |
| Later | discuss runtime API / split-ready evolution only after product hardening is proven | independent-product evidence remains stable after Stage 5 |

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | Goal | Depends On | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Stage 1: design baseline](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md#stage-1-design-and-documentation-baseline) | completed | freeze product naming, boundaries, and document stack | none | architecture, module boundaries, and testing surfaces are aligned |
| [Stage 2: local-first baseline](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md#stage-2-local-first-implementation-baseline) | completed | ship one governed local-first end-to-end baseline | Stage 1 | core modules, adapters, standalone CLI, and governance all run |
| [Stage 3: self-learning lifecycle baseline](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md#stage-3-self-learning-lifecycle-baseline) | completed | turn the already-implemented reflection baseline into an explicit lifecycle with promotion, decay, and learning-specific governance | Stage 2 | promotion / decay expectations, learning governance, OpenClaw validation, and local governed loop are all implemented and regression-protected |
| [Stage 4: policy adaptation](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md#stage-4-policy-adaptation-and-multi-consumer-use) | completed | let governed learning outputs influence consumer behavior | Stage 3 | one reversible policy-adaptation loop is proven |
| [Stage 5: product hardening](reference/unified-memory-core/development-plan.md#stage-5-product-hardening-and-independent-operation) | next | validate split-ready and independent-product operation | Stage 4 | release boundary, reproducibility, and maintenance workflows are stable |

## Risks and Dependencies

- the current roadmap should not drift away from `.codex/status.md` and `.codex/plan.md`
- `todo.md` should remain personal scratch space, not a competing status source
- the next dependency is no longer the Stage 4 contract; it is the Stage 5 hardening order
- Stage 4 policy reports and loops must stay readable while later hardening opens
